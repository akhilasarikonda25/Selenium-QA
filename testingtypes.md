Function                          
1. Integration 
2. Ui Testing 
3. Uat 
4. Unit Testing
5. System Testing 
6. Regression

Non Functional 
1. Security Testing 
2. Reliability Testing
3.Load Testing
4. Usability 
5. Stress Testing 

As A Qa tester mainly it focus on the Functional testing 

Functional Testing 

1. Integration Testing : if different systems are tested in a combined way, then that will be integration testing.

Non Functional Testing 

1)Load testing : Load testing is to apply load on application to chec wheather it able to handle n number of customer load 

2) Stress testing : By increasing the load beyond the requirement and check whether at any point of view the system crashing or not.

3) security esting : It is a part related to hacking 

4) Usability testing : Wheather the application is easty to use or not
