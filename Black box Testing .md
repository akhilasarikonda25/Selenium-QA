Black box testing : Testing should done without knowing the internal structure of the code is called black box testing.

The methodologies of black box testing are of below 

1) Boundary value analysis : The values which are not exceed  the boundaries values that technique is called boundary value analysis 

     ex : There is one text box that is enter age 

     note:  this age should accepts 21 to 65 

    a) Invalid test case : enter the belo 20 ( min -1 )

    b) valid test case 21,22,65,64  ( min, +min ,max ,-max)

    c) invalid tc : invalid +1 ( 65+1 )=66

2) Equivalence partitioning  : we take range of values 

     ex : There is one text box that is enter age 

     note:  this age should accepts 21 to 65 
     
    a) Invalid test case : check lessthan > 21

    b) valid test case : ( min, +min ,max ,-max)   21>=age <=65

    c) invalid tc : test by giving >65 ( greater than )

3)State transition or testing or graph : Based on visualtion of graph we will know the state 

for exaple : login to banck account :

4) descion table testing : It basically figure out all the test scenarios figureout the tcs 

  Example : banck account

5) Error guessing technique: basically in this case we have to find out the major errors
